# Active noise cancellation headsets

Noise cancelling headphones are an ideal choice for many music listeners for their ability to cut out ambient noise without raising the audio volume to levels that might be dangerous for the ear. Even with no music playing, the headphones have the ability to mute ambient noise â€“ perfect for those trying to work or sleep in noisy environments as airplanes, factories, etc.

Noise cancellation can be achieved in many modes, from **DSP** to **analog circuitry**.

In this small presentation we will discuss about an analog circuit able to reduce noise targetting certain frequencies.

For each channel we have a:

**MICROPHONE SETTING STAGE**

**MICROPHONE PREAMPLIFICATION STAGE**

**ALLPASS CIRCUIT for delaying and timing**

**INVERTING ADDER**

**SPEAKER**
